Physics bachelor thesis codes.

All main programs are in src, while its inputs are inside inp.
The main code is sir\_mut.f90, but a lot of auxiliary codes are also present.
If someone is interested I may describe what every code is doing.

Folders bin, obj and data are there for compiling purposes

The scripts folder contains bash scripts used to execute the main codes.

The input networks should be in an edge list format (see net.example)

Abstract:
In this work we consider a variation of the SIR model where mutations of the pathogen are allowed.
We discuss the appearance of an endemic phase using a mean-field approximation and solve the stochastic model using Monte Carlo simulations.
We find that our model has three distinct phases and serves as an interpolation between the SIR and SIS models.
